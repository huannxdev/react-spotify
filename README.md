# Spotify
##Hi there ðŸ‘‹
This project was generated using [Nx](https://nx.dev).
A simple Spotify client built with React Hooks, TailwindCss, Nx workspace

### Working application
Check out the **live application** -> https://spotify-react-nx.web.app/

**Spotify premium** is required for the Web Playback SDK to play music. If you are using a free account, you can still browse the app, but it couldn't play the music. Spotify premium account is so cheap ðŸ¤£

## Tech stack
- Reactjs with function component, redux
- Nx Workspace
- TailwindCss
- Antd
- Firebase for deployment

#### âœ¨ I'm still developed new features and update to production while finish a feature. I'm welcome any idea about coding, structure or anything about the features. Enjoy
